Front end ecommerce website: Anime Art by Dhruv Parasrampuria

This is a single page bootstrap ecom website unlike other bulky websites.
This gives the website a more minimalist and aesthetic look.

The landing page: Contains basic name of the website along with navigation bar,social media handles etc..
The highlight of this page goes to the background(your name op) and the typing animation which is made using typed.js . 
Note: A lot of animation is used in this but just enough to not make it look heavy.All of these animations are done by aos.js(automateonscroll).

Shop now : This page contains artist portfolio images selling anime art along with sorting products according to their category. Each item has a display full image button and buy now button.  The sort product button is working by the isotope-layout.js.
	Buy now:this is just and example page for all items, displaying the use of jpegs along with price name and artist details.it's basically a lightbox made from glightbox.js library

About : nothing special basic designing to put pieces of the website together
Login:  simple login section made using bootstrap.not linked

Footer : it exists, that's it.

Learning process: I have done a front end webdev course in 9th grade but after 4 years the knowledge had got rusty . I am still in the process of relearning and revising .Thanks to the team I got a perfect hands on experience.
I made the basic structure in html without any thought.Then proceeded to properly plan it. To make it mobile friendly bootstrap was the best option.
I keep looking at other websites to understand what I really want and what not. Other parts of the process include discovering new js libraries and including them in my website.
